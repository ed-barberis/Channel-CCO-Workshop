# Build Steps for Preparing the Workshop
## Overview

The provisioning, configuration, and preparation needed for delivering the Cisco Full Stack Observability 
(FSO) series of workshops can be an extremely tedious and time-consuming challenge for SE's. To solve 
that problem, the FSO Lab DevOps project delivers a set of artifacts to automate the build, deployment, 
and configuration portion of these pre-workshop activities using open source tooling.

## Build and Deployment Tools

Although there are many tools available to accomplish the project's automation goals, it was decided to 
standardize on [Packer](https://www.packer.io/), [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), and 
[Terraform Cloud](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) from HashiCorp. This is primarily due 
to their capability for building and deploying software platforms to multi-cloud environments, as well 
as having a high level of adoption within the developer community.

### Packer

[Packer](https://packer.io/) is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple 
platforms from a single source configuration. Packer is lightweight, runs on every major operating system, 
and is highly performant. A machine image (or immutable VM image) is a single static unit that contains 
a pre-configured operating system and installed software which is used to quickly create new running 
machines.  

As part of this project, Packer is used to create an immutable Lab VM image consisting of a standardized 
installation of Amazon Linux 2 with a set of common software. This static image is later used by Terraform 
when standing-up the infrastructure and compute resources needed by workshop participants. Currently, this 
VM consists of the following type:

-	__LPAD VM__: A 'Launchpad' Lab VM with pre-configured tooling for Kubernetes and AWS CLI Operations.

For SE-lead workshops, the Lab VM image is built and maintained by Cisco/AppDynamics. However, all of the 
artifacts used to build the image are present in this project, so customers are free to customize and 
build their own VM images if desired.  

### Terraform

[Terraform](https://terraform.io/) is a tool for building, changing, and versioning infrastructure 
safely and efficiently. Terraform can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom 
in-house solutions. The infrastructure Terraform can manage includes low-level components such as compute 
instances, storage, and networking, as well as high-level components such as DNS entries, SaaS features, 
etc.  

In this project, Terraform is used to automate the deployment of the Lab infrastructure, including VPCs, 
subnets, security groups, load balancers, Kubdernetes clusters, and Lab VM using templates.

### Terraform Cloud

[Terraform Cloud](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/terraform) is HashiCorpâ€™s managed service offering 
for Terraform. It eliminates the need for unnecessary tooling and documentation for practitioners, teams, 
and organizations to use Terraform in production.

## Get Started

To configure the FSO Lab workshop environments, the first step is to set-up your development environment 
by installing the needed software.

### Prerequisites

You install Packer and Terraform on a control node, usually your local laptop, which then uses the 
cloud CLI and/or SSH to communicate with your cloud resources and managed nodes.

__NOTE:__ A remote Virtual Machine with access to the internet can also be used as the control node. The 
specific instructions for installing the required software are left as an exercise for the reader.

## Installation Instructions - macOS
